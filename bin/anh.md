I have seen so many cartoons when i was a chid, but i like doraemon the most. The episodes always revolve around the daily stories of Doraemon, Nobita and Doraemon’s treasures. In the movie, who I like best is Nobita. This guy is quite clumsy but has a compassionate heart, he likes to help people around. Nobita always loves life and optimism, this makes the audience feel entertained. In short, the film is very meaning, i love it very much.
